Mavensdotlive uses a ‘pre-booking system’. For each class, Instructors

place. Here’s how it works:

    **‘minimum no. of students required to activate class’**.
2.  Click ‘add to cart’ and then your personal details will be required.
    Your enrollment is then being processed.
3.  You then wait for us to email you if the class is activated or not.

    will require you to pay.
